cat("Hello, aliens, welcome to our land! It’s so wonderful to meet another species who can occupy the same land as us. We, as the human race, would love to learn more about you! like what is your main form of sustenance? Ours is mainly water and different types of food. To give a little more background about us, we speak many different languages, and this current one I’m typing in is English. We’re a very diverse set of species, all unified by our ability to walk on two legs and communicate to each other intelligently. We’re so excited to get to know more about your species and hope you are excited to get to know about us!")
